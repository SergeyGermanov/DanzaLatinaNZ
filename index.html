                            of Salsa is a combination of Afro-Cuban dance, Cuban Son, cha-cha-cha, mambo and other dance
                            forms. Different regions of Latin America and the United States have distinct salsa styles of
                            their own, such as Cuban, Puerto Rican, Cali Colombia, L.A. and New York styles. Salsa dance

                    <p>The authentic dance from the Dominican Republic in the Caribbean is a basic dance sequence in a full
                        8-count moving within a square. Dancers in the Western world much later made up a basic step going
                        from side to side, and also copied dance elements from other couple dances of various origins, Latin
                        and non Latin alike. The basic dance sequence consists of three steps and then a tap step or various
                        forms of step syncopation (such as the "double step"). Some dancers in the west accompany the tap
                        with an exaggerated "pop” of the hips. Bachata can be danced on the 1st beat of the musical phrase,
                        with the tap on the 4th beat, but dancing on the 2nd, 3rd or 4th beat is also common. The tap is
                        done on the opposite foot of the last step, while the next step is taken on the same foot as the
                        tap. The dance direction changes after the tap or fourth step.

                    <p>Tango is a partner dance which originated in the 1880s along the River Plate (Río de Plata), the natural
                        border between Argentina and Uruguay. It was born in the impoverished port areas of these countries,
                        where natives mixed with slave and European immigrant populations. The tango is the result of a combination
                        of the German Waltz, Czech Polka, Polish Mazurka, and Bohemian Schottische with the Spanish-Cuban
                        Habanera, African Candombe, and Argentinian Milonga. The tango was frequently practiced in the brothels
                        and bars of ports, where business owners employed bands to entertain their patrons with music. The
                        tango then spread to the rest of the world. Many variations of this dance currently exist around
                        the world.

                        Zouk music, from where it got the name "Zouk". (the dance style originated in Brazil and the music
                        style to be distinguished from each other). Brazilian Zouk came eventually to be danced to a broad

                    <h5>Music genre</h5>
                    <p>The origins of kizomba can be traced to late-1970s Africa, with influences variably attributed to
                        Angola.Kizomba is characterised by a slower, romantic, more sensuous rhythm than the traditional
                        Angolan semba dance. Kizomba music emerged as a more modern music genre with a sensual touch mixed
                        with African rhythm and Haitian compas. Most kizomba songs are sung in Portuguese. Cape Verdean singers
                        and producers with kizomba compilations include Suzanna Lubrano, Kaysha, Z-BeatZ Pro AudioHustlin',
                        Atim, Nilton Ramalho, Johnny Ramos, Nelson Freitas, Mika Mendes, Manu Lima, Cedric Cavaco, Elji,
                        Looney Johnson, Klazzik, Mark G, To Semedo, Beto Dias, Heavy H, Marcia, Gilyto, Kido Semedo, Ricky
                        Boy, Klaudio Ramos, M&N Pro, Gilson, Gil, G-Amado, Philip Monteiro, Gama, Juceila Cardoso and Denis
                        Graça. Original influential music styles from Cape Verde are funaná, morna, coladeira and batuque.
                        Thanks to the French Antilles zouk music and the strong influence of semba (from Angola), Cape Verdean
                        singers have developed significantly kizomba and zouk (mixing it with coladeira) known as cabo love
                        or cola-dance. Moreover, every lusophone country has developed its own Kizomba music flavour.
                    </p>
                    <h5>Dance genre</h5>
                    <p>A couple dances kizomba Semba has been danced in the 1950s in Angola. In the 1990s, when the actual
                        kizomba music got more and more popular, Angolan semba dancers started to adapt their semba steps
                        according to the tempo and flavour of the Kizomba beats.[4] The Kizomba dance is a couple dance from
                        which many styles such as, tarraxinha and Kizomba 2.0 (also known as Urban kiz) derived from.

                    <p>Merengue is a style of Dominican music and dance. Partners hold each other in a closed position. The
                        leader holds the follower's waist with the leader's right hand, while holding the follower's right
                        hand with the leader's left hand at the follower's eye level. Partners bend their knees slightly
                        left and right, thus making the hips move left and right. The hips of the leader and follower move
                        in the same direction throughout the song. Partners may walk sideways or circle each other, in small
                        steps. They can switch to an open position and do separate turns without letting go each other's
                        hands or releasing one hand. During these turns they may twist and tie their handhold into intricate
                        pretzels. Other choreographies are possible.

                    <p>In the early 1950s, Enrique Jorrín worked as a violinist and composer with the charanga group Orquesta
                        América. The group performed at dance halls in Havana where they played danzón, danzonete, and danzon-mambo
                        for dance-orientated crowds. Jorrín noticed that many of the dancers at these gigs had difficulty
                        with the syncopated rhythms of the danzón-mambo. To make his music more appealing to dancers, Jorrín
                        began composing songs where the melody was marked strongly on the first downbeat and the rhythm was
                        less syncopated. When Orquesta América performed these new compositions at the Silver Star Club in
                        Havana, it was noticed that the dancers had improvised a triple step in their footwork producing
                        the sound "cha-cha-cha". Thus, the new style came to be known as "cha-cha-chá" and became associated
                        with a dance where dancers perform a triple step. The basic footwork pattern of cha-cha-chá (two,
                        three, cha-cha-cha) is also found in several Afro-Cuban dances from the Santería religion. For example,
                        one of the steps used in the dance for the orisha Ogun uses an identical footwork pattern. These
                        Afro-Cuban dances predate the development of cha-cha-chá and were known by many Cubans in the 1950s,
                        especially those of African origin. Thus, the footwork of the cha-cha-chá was likely inspired by
                        these Afro-Cuban dances.

                    <p>Samba is a lively, rhythmical dance of Afro-Brazilian origin in 2/4(2 by 4) time danced to Samba music
                        whose origins include the Maxixe. Samba is a dance to black/African people in Brazil who brought
                        much of their music and dance culture into Latin America with them upon arrival into many Latin American
                        countries. Samba music is very similar to and has been influenced by many Angolan music genres. It
                        has also been influenced by many other Latin American music genres and dances. The Samba music rhythm
                        has been danced in Brazil since its inception in the late 16th century. There is actually a set of
                        dances, rather than a single dance, that define the Samba dancing scene in Brazil; however, no one
                        dance can be claimed with certainty as the "original" Samba style.

                    <p>Sandungueo, or perreo, is a dance associated with reggaeton which emerged during the early 1990s in
                        Puerto Rico. It focuses on grinding, with one partner facing the back of the other (usually male
                        behind female). Another way of describing this dance is "back-to-front", where the woman presses
                        her rear into the pelvis of her partner to create sexual stimulation. Since traditional couple dancing
                        is face-to-face (such as square dancing and the waltz), reggaeton dancing initially shocked observers
                        with its sensuality but was featured in several music videos. It is known as daggering, grinding
                        or juking in the U.S.
