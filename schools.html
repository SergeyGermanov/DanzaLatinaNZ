                            Jorge (Coco) Sequeiros was born in Peru, South America and has been living in New Zealand since November 1991 and dancing
                            Salsa for as long as he can remember. Salsa being a passion for him wasn’t enough so it also
                            became his way of life, a way of life which he is trying to share with New Zealanders so that
                            they also will know the passion of the dancing, music, food and culture of his homeland. Coco
                            considers his Salsa style to be a Kiwi style originally derived from a combination of the Salsa
                            of Peru and the Salsa danced in New Zealand!

                            Zouk Art started as a brand where we could combine both our artistic and creative natures into the dance, Brazilian Zouk.
                            It has now become a dance school specialising in Brazilian Dances, both Zouk and Samba de Gafieira
                            - where we are dedicated to a syllabus that will teach you solid fundamentals from the ground
                            up so that any student keen to learn how to dance CAN. We teach classes, workshops, run performance
                            teams, can provide ‘dance privates’ and we also choreograph our own performances. We love to
                            work with all styles of dance, different schools and are always open to new and exciting opportunities.

                            Bay Salsa is a community based club that promotes and fosters street Latin dance in the Bay of Plenty. We are a group of
                            people who enjoy salsa socially and run a number of parties through the year. Bay Salsa run classes
                            in bachata, salsa and zouk in Tauranga. It is also home to the Bay Salsa Festival, which seeks
                            to support New Zealand Salsa by providing a stage to grow and develop as well as financial grants
                            for those teams representing New Zealand on the world stage.
